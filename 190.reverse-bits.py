# Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

# Note:

# Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, both input and output will be given as a signed integer type. They should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
# In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 2 above, the input represents the signed integer -3 and the output represents the signed integer -1073741825.
 

# Example 1:

# Input: n = 00000010100101000001111010011100
# Output:    964176192 (00111001011110000010100101000000)
# Explanation: The input binary string 00000010100101000001111010011100 represents the unsigned integer 43261596, so return 964176192 which its binary representation is 00111001011110000010100101000000.

class Solution:
    def reverseBits(self, n: int) -> int:
        f = format(n,'b')
        f = '0' * (32 - len(f)) + f
        return int(f[::-1],2)
